## Key Concepts

Trendz Metric Explorer allows you to create new metrics from existing telemetries. Let's describe the flow of metric creation:

### Metric Definition

A Metric Definition is an object that describes a future metric. Basically, it includes:

1. **Metric Name** - The name that will appear in the fields tab (in the generated metrics folder).
2. **Metric Description** - A short description explaining what this metric should do.
3. **How to calculate metrics** - A step-by-step instruction explaining how to calculate this metric.

A Metric Definition does not have any implementation, it’s just a textual description of what should be implemented - a blueprint for a future metric.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="metric-definition" %}

### Generated Metric

A Generated Metric is an implemented metric definition. It contains Python code that can be executed to generate telemetry 
points (graph or table of values). A metric does not represent points in ThingsBoard, it calculates values in real time. 
Also, you cannot use a generated metric directly in the Trendz ecosystem - it’s just a template for a future ThingsBoard telemetry.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="generated-metric" %}

### Native Calculation Field

Each metric can be converted into a **Native Calculation Field**. This field contains the code from the metric that is already integrated
into the Trendz ecosystem. At this level, we still do not have points in ThingsBoard, but we can use this Calculation Field as a
real-time Calculation Field.

Read more about Native Calculation Fields [here](/docs/trendz/calculations/native/).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="native-calculation" %}

### Native Calculation Field with Telemetry Points

To save telemetry points to ThingsBoard, it’s necessary to set up a **reprocess** or **refresh job** for the Native Calculation Field.

The flow of saving metric telemetry to ThingsBoard is described [here](/docs/trendz/metric/save-to-thingsboard/).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="native-calculation-with-telemetry" %}

## Create New Metric

To create a new metric, you need to:

1. Choose the business entity for which the metric will be generated.
2. Choose the item on which the metric will be tested.
3. Choose the timerange on which the metric will be tested.
4. Click **+ New Metric**.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="create-new-metric" %}

You will see two options:

### AI Suggestions

The AI agent will propose six different metrics based on your telemetries and topology. You can check each metric
by clicking on it - you will see a metric definition (name, description, and how it’s calculated) and use cases.

If you don’t like the generated metrics, click **Refresh Ideas** to generate new AI suggestions.

If you like a metric, click **Implement Field**. Then you will be redirected to the **Generated Metric Overview** tab.
This tab’s functionality will be covered later in this article.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="ai-suggestions" %}

**Important note:** AI Suggestions are disabled if the AI Feature **Metric AI Assistant** is not enabled. Learn how to enable it [here]().

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="ai-suggestions-without-ai" %}

### Create Manually

This option allows you to create any metric you want, with or without AI assistance. 
To switch to it, click **Create Manually** button.

If you want to generate a metric without AI, just submit a **Field Name**. You will see this name in the
generated metrics folder.

If you want to generate it with AI, click the checkbox **Use AI to create metric**, and then fill in these fields:

1. **Description and Computation Logic** - Describe what your field should do and how it should be implemented.
2. **Use Relations** - If yes, this code will be able to use telemetries from related entities.

When everything is submitted, click **Create Custom Field** and you will be redirected to the overview tab with the generated code.
This functionality is described in the next section.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="create-manually" %}

**Important note:** Generate with AI is disabled if the AI Feature **Metric AI Assistant** is not enabled. Learn how to enable it [here]().

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="create-manually-without-ai" %}

## Generated Metrics Actions

You can access the **Generated Metrics Overview** section in several ways:

1. Click on any metric from the **Generated Metric Fields** section.
2. Implement a metric using methods from the **Create New Metric** section of this documentation.

If you generated the metric without AI, you will see an empty code editor; otherwise, you will see AI-generated code.

### Code Editor

In the code editor, you can write or modify metric code. This code has the same syntax as the Native Calculation Field.
You can read about it [here](/docs/trendz/calculations/native/).

Once the code is modified, you can save it using the **Save Changes** button or revert changes using **Cancel Changes** button.

If the code has problems, you’ll see a red cross next to the line with the issue.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="code-editor" %}

### Test Code

To test code, press the **Run Test** button. Then you’ll be redirected to the graph. The logic of this graph is the
same as in the overview tab of a regular metric. This graph or table will show points that the metric code
generates for the chosen item. You can read more about the overview tab [here](/docs/trendz/metric/overview/#overview-tab).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="test-code" %}

### Show Logs

To access the log section, click the **Logs** button in the upper-left corner of the screen.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="show-logs" %}

### Show Details

To view the Metric Definition from which this metric was created, click the **Metric Details** button.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="show-details" %}

### AI Assistance

To interact with AI Assistance, click the **Ask AI** button. Here you can:

1. Ask questions about the code.
2. Ask AI to rewrite the code.
3. Ask AI to fix bugs.

In the chat interface you can:

1. Ask new questions by typing in the text field.
2. Check code generated in previous interactions by clicking on your messages.
3. Edit previous messages to rerun them with changes.
4. Clear chat history.

**Important note:** The AI assistant is disabled if the AI Feature **Metric AI Assistant** is not enabled. Learn how to enable it [here]().

### Use in Trendz and ThingsBoard

You can use the metric across Trendz and even ThingsBoard by saving it to the Native Calculation. To do this:

1. Click **Save Calculation**.
2. Enter the calculation **name** (shown in Trendz) and **key** (shown in ThingsBoard).
3. Click **Save**.

Now the calculation is saved in Trendz and can be used there as a real-time calculation field.

To save telemetries to ThingsBoard:

1. Verify the **grouping interval** (the value of `groupBy` for reprocess or refresh job).
2. Verify **aggregation** (the aggregation method used inside each grouping interval).
3. Verify **time** (strategy for the refresh job).

We recommend setting the time as follows:

* **Today** if job frequency is minute or hour.
* **Last 7 days** if job frequency is day.
* **Last 14 days** if job frequency is week.
* **Last 3 months** if job frequency is month.

Then it’s possible to run a **reprocess job** - it saves telemetry in ThingsBoard once for a historical period. You can also
set up a **refresh job** - it saves telemetry in ThingsBoard regularly. Learn how to set up refresh and reprocess jobs [here]().

### Other Actions

To rename a metric:

1. Click the **Change Name** button next to the metric name.
2. Enter a new name.
3. Click **Save**.

To delete a metric:

1. Click the **Delete** button next to the metric name.
2. Click **Delete** again to confirm.

If the metric has an associated Calculation Field, you can:

* Open it by clicking on the **Open Calculation** button.
* Update existing Calculation or create new one (if create, then now metric will be tied with last created calculation).

## Tabs Section

It's possible to see **Statistics**, **Time Patterns**, and **Range Analysis** for a generated metric only if it has a 
corresponding Native Calculation, for which telemetry data is present in ThingsBoard for the chosen time range.

If a Native Calculation isn't created for the chosen metric, you will be prompted to create a Calculation Field from it.

If a Native Calculation was created from the chosen metric but has no points in the selected time range, you will be prompted
to run a reprocess job to save data points to ThingsBoard.

Read more about these tabs [here]().

## Best Practices

1. If you need to create a specific metric, use AI to create it in **Manual** mode.
2. If generated code isn’t working: check logs, verify relations.
3. If generated code fails by timeout: increase it for the Python Executor or check how often `get_telemetries`
   is called. If it’s called in a loop, ask AI to call it once per device. This can improve performance. You
   can also decrease the time range to reduce the number of analyzed points.
4. Give clear instructions to AI - not just “Fix my code,” but point out the cause of the bug.
5. Save your work regularly using the **Save** button.
6. You can ask AI to create code with more comments to explain what each part does or ask it to remove them to make
   the code more readable. You can also ask it to add more logs for better debugging in the logs section.
